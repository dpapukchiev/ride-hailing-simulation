# No Backward Compatibility Policy

- When introducing new features or refactoring, do not maintain backward compatibility with old APIs or behaviors.
- Remove deprecated code immediately rather than keeping it for compatibility.
- Update all call sites to use the new approach.
- This allows for cleaner code and faster iteration without legacy baggage.
