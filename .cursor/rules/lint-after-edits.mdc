# Lint After Edits

- After making substantive code edits, **always** run the linter on the edited files using the ReadLints tool.
- If new linter errors are introduced by your changes, fix them before moving on.
- Do not call the linter on files you have not edited.
- Pre-existing linter warnings that are unrelated to your changes can be ignored unless fixing them is trivial.
