# No Dead Code Policy

- Do not use `#[allow(dead_code)]` or similar attributes to suppress dead code warnings.
- Remove dead code immediately rather than leaving it commented out or marked as allowed.
- When deprecating code, remove it entirely rather than leaving deprecated paths.
- If code is temporarily unused but planned for future use, document why it's kept and when it will be used.
- Dead code includes:
  - Unused functions, methods, structs, enums, or modules
  - Unused imports
  - Unreachable code paths
  - Unused variables (unless they're intentionally prefixed with `_` for pattern matching)
- Run `cargo check` and `cargo test` to verify no dead code warnings before committing.
