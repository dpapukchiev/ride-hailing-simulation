  and complete or cancel the trip.
  Status: Done

  window. The system continuously updates pickup ETAs as drivers move, and I
  cancel if the projected pickup time (now + ETA) exceeds my wait deadline.
  Status: Done

- Story: As a rider, I decide to book based on price elasticity and my maximum
  willingness to pay.
