## Core Simulation

- Story: As a simulation runner, I can advance time by popping the next event so
  the simulation is deterministic and efficient.
  Status: Done

- Story: As a scenario author, I can spawn riders and drivers with randomized
  H3 positions and request times for reproducible runs.
  Status: Done

- Story: As a trip lifecycle engine, I can create trips, move drivers to pickup,
  start trips, and complete trips with timestamps for KPIs.
  Status: Done

- Story: As a researcher, I can generate scenario permutations from a config
  manifest to run experiment batches.
  Status: Backlog
